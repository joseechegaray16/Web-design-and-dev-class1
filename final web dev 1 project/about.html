    <p>
        I am a lifelong learner who takes pride in being in uncomfortable situations.
        I am self taught in every creative and artistic domain I happen to be dabbling in.
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy being a jack of all trades as my projects will prove that to be the case.
        I don't have a one size fits all approach when dealing with new customers or any project that I decide to take on.
        I enjoy working with other people as I believe inspiration can strike at any moment and collaboration is an essential component to any project. 
    </p>

        <strong>History</strong>
    </h3>

    <p>
        My journey to being a digital nomad wasn't a direct one.
        For the longest time my interests were leaning more towards something in the medical field rather than the technological sector.
        However, I found myself feeling depleted and suffering from severe loss of motivation.
        So I began exploring other areas of potential work that seemed interesting and sure enough I found what it was I wanted to do.

        <strong>Interests</strong>
    </h3>

    <p>
        My tastes in hobbies and interests vary greatly as I am the most curious person I know.
        One of my favorite things to do when I have downtime is watch short films at <a href="https://www.shortoftheweek.com/" target="_blank">shortoftheweek.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Reading is one of my favorite pastimes and I am a sucker for anything that has to do with space.
        I always love learning new software because it allows me to broaden my skillset and help funnel new ideas of creativity.
        Just like everyone else I am infatuated with travel and any chance I get to vist a new place I jump at the opportunity to do so.
